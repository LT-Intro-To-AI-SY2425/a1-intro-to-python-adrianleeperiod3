# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

I find the python programming language to be quicker and more intuitive than I'd consider java to be. However since I learned java first, some aspects of python feel incorret or confusing. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python feels more direct as to what I am trying to instruct the program to do, as Java typically requires more tedious instruction in order to complete simple tasks. Additionally, Java needs specific definitions in data types for each variable, while Python's declaration is interpretive. 

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Through this assignment, I learned how to translate familar aspects I learned on Java into Python code for problem solving. I also learned that Python has built-in functions that execute tasks that would otherwise take multiple steps in Java coding. Once I become more knowledgable and comfortable with Python, coding with it will likely be faster.
